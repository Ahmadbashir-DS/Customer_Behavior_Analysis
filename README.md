## 🧹 Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering using **Python**.

### 🔧 Steps:
- **Data Loading:** Imported dataset using `pandas`.
- **Initial Exploration:** Checked structure with `.info()` and summary statistics with `.describe()`.
- **Missing Data Handling:** Imputed missing `Review Rating` values using median by category.
- **Column Standardization:** Renamed columns to snake_case for readability.
- **Feature Engineering:**
  - Created `age_group` column by binning customer ages.
  - Created `purchase_frequency_days` column based on purchase history.
- **Redundancy Check:** Verified if `discount_applied` and `promo_code_used` were redundant; dropped `promo_code_used`.
- **Database Integration:** Loaded the cleaned dataset into **PostgreSQL** for SQL analysis.
